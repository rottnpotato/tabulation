* Remember we have Postgre DB.

* This is the admin features of our app, implement these features and create a progress.md file to track the progress of the implementation. always check the markdown file so that you wont have to repeat implementing a feature. check it on every request. log it carefully with date and timestamp and the description of your progress or what you have worked on.

* On your implementation, provide it full that is working and functional. The stack is Laravel 12 inertia vue. When creating a view or UI it should be visually appealing, be creative but not over the top and follow the overall theme and aesthetics of the app.

* Do not run "npm run dev" and "php artisan serve" commands.
