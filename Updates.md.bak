Investigated the event display functionality between organizer and admin sides. The organizer can add events (both milestone and non-milestone) through the Events tab in the PageantView, but there are issues with real-time updates and notifications on the admin side:

2. There's no real-time notification system to alert admins when organizers add or update events.
3. The scheduled event reminders aren't functioning as expected.

Action items:
- Implement real-time event updates using Laravel Echo and Pusher
- Add a notification system to alert admins of event changes
- Ensure events properly update the pageant progress section on the admin side

- Shows different notification types based on the event action (create, update, delete)
- Highlights milestone events with higher visibility notifications
